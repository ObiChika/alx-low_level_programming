0x12. C - Singly linked lists
Write a function that prints all the elements of a list_t list.
A linked list is a fundamental data structure in C that consists of a series of nodes, where each node contains a data element and a pointer to the next node in the list. Linked lists are dynamic in nature, meaning they can grow or shrink in size during program execution.
